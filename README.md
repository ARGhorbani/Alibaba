# Project: API Backend for Android Application

This project provides a PHP-based API backend with a MySQL database to serve data for an Android application. The API handles requests and delivers data seamlessly to the app.

---

## Features
- **PHP-Based API**: Efficient and lightweight API endpoints.
- **MySQL Database**: Well-structured database for storing and managing data.
- **JSON Responses**: Provides data in a structured and standard JSON format.
- **Designed for Android**: Optimized for communication with Android applications.

---

## File Structure

- `api/` : Contains all API endpoints written in PHP.
- `db/` : Includes database connection files.
- `config/` : Configuration files for database and environment variables.
- `README.md` : Documentation for the project.

---

## Requirements

- **Server Requirements:**
  - PHP 7.4 or higher
  - MySQL 5.7 or higher
  - Apache or Nginx Web Server

- **Dependencies:**
  - PHP extensions: `mysqli`, `json`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Configure Database
- Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) into your MySQL server:
  ```bash
  mysql -u username -p database_name < database.sql
  ```
- Update `config/db.php` with your database credentials:
  ```php
  <?php
  define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
  define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
  define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
  define('DB_NAME', 'your_database');
  ?>
  ```

### 3. Deploy the API
- Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for LAMP).
- Access the API from your server's base URL, e.g., `http://localhost/api`.
